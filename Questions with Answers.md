# Java, Spring Boot & System Design – Interview Notes

This repository contains **concise, interview-focused explanations** of core **Java, Collections, Spring Boot, Database, and Performance concepts**.

## A. Core Java

### Immutable Class
An immutable class is one whose state cannot be changed after creation (e.g., `String`).  
Achieved using `final` class, `final` fields, no setters, and defensive copying.

### String, StringBuilder, StringBuffer
- `String` → Immutable, thread-safe
- `StringBuilder` → Mutable, not thread-safe (fastest)
- `StringBuffer` → Mutable, thread-safe (slower)

### Wrapper Classes
Object representations of primitive types used in collections and generics.

### OOPS Concepts
Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction.

### 3 Pillars of OOPS

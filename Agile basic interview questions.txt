Agile Interview Basics

10 working Day 1 Sprint, 8 story points per day

FDD (Feature-Driven Development): It generally involves creating software models every two weeks and also needs development and design for each and every model feature. It is basically a lightweight iterative and incremental software development process whose main purpose is to deliver stable and working software on time.  

1.	Product owner creates JIRA Stories for features , product owner has access to customers and cannot become scrum master
2.	Scrum master facilitates 
	•	Stand-ups - Daily
	•	Iteration/sprint planning meetings – 1 once every sprint (10 Days)
	•	Sprint reviews & Retrospectives - 2 Days in a sprint
	•	Maintain reporting - burn down chart
	•	Prioritize back log
3.	Spike: It generally refers to a too large and complex user story in software development that cannot be estimated until the development team runs a timeboxed investigation. These stories can be used for various activities like research, design, exploration, prototyping, etc. Spikes are usually created to resolve some technical issues and design problems in the project. 
4.	Zero Sprint: It generally refers to the first step or pre-preparation step that comes just before the first sprint. It includes all activities such as setting a development environment, preparing backlog, etc.
5.	Velocity : Forecast vs Actual
6.	Daily standup
	•	Better understand goals
	•	what was done yesterday and what is the plan for today.
	•	Stay organized

Iterative Development: It is basically a software development process where software development cycles (sprint and releases) are repeated until the final product is obtained. On the basis of feedback from customers or users, the product is again developed in cycles or releases and sprints i.e., adding new functionality in a repetitive manner. 

Advantages of Scrum 

•	Releases product quickly to users and customers 
•	Ensures effective use of time and money and therefore saves cost 
•	Ability to incorporates changes as they occur 
•	Emphasizes creativity and innovation to increase business value 
•	Large and complex projects are divided into small and easily manageable sprints
